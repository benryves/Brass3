Please copy ROM dumps for the calculators that you wish to debug with here.

You should name the dumps according to the following table:

Calculator  ROM name   Size
----------- --------   -----
TI-83 Plus  TI8X.rom   512KB
TI-83       TI83.rom   256KB      
TI-82       TI82.rom   128KB

Before using the TI-83 Plus ROM, please open it in a regular PindurTI instance and
reset all memory. The debugger scripts send keystrokes blindly to the emulator, and
having unexpected programs or applications in their menus will prevent them from
working correctly.
